        <p>
            Full Stack Development program is interesting and educating. It is a journey I have come to understand that it is quite assiduous, and is always captivating. I am happy for this journey, most especially being part of the CapacityBay family and community. Anyone can decide to do a personal study, which is still good, but learning with a team opens one up to different types of knowledge, ideas, and these make what is learnt a lasting knowledge. A lot of things interest me, and one of the intriguing thing has always being the patience the Faculties while teaching. They amaze me with their calmness and ability to carry everyone along, making sure nobody was left behind. Our classes for that reason is always wonderful, and I really appreciate everyone of them. Sure, we are still scratching the surface, but Iâ€™m hopeful to work hard and get to the finish line.  We are now almost done with HTML, more languages are still in the cooler; JavaScript, CSS, etc.,   I believe we (students) are expectant and excited. I look forward to enjoying every bit of it.
